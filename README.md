# WeatherPrediction
Predict the weather so I know when to head to the beach.

## Purpose of the Project


## Methodology (Data)

For a year, give me the second table after the graphs for months:
	February - September

Grabbed the whole year (minus January) for 2020 so that an accurate prediction can occur for 2021
	Data constraint more than anything.

## Where data is collected from

All data grabbed from this website

https://www.wunderground.com/history/monthly/us/fl/pensacola/KPNS/date/2021-2

Looking at the URL can probably scrape next time

## Things I want to improve

 - Precipitation prediction
 - Centralize functions into a script in custom_packages
 - Make notebooks more readable (shorter)
 - Collect data for 2021 and 2022
